# Sudoku

This is a simple mobile Sudoku game made with .NET Maui. There are no difficulty options and the Sudoku pattern can become really predictable the more you play. This app was made with the purpose of
practicing and familiarizing with .NET Maui. It's not that complicated. Might come back to clean it up a bit.
